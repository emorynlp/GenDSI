# Hallucination (MAP: Non-existing slots)

The slot-value pair represents information that appears to be made 
up by the model since it is neither explicitly derivable from the turn 
nor does it constitute information that is inferrable from the turn. 

## Example
Turn: Okay, we'll definitely need to avoid peanuts and lower your sodium intake 
to manage your blood pressure. Are you currently physically active?

activity_level: ?
**is_alcohol_served: ?** 

# Leakage (MAP: Hallucination)

The slot-value pair represents information that is only attributable to a previous
turn in the dialogue, instead of being derivable from the focal turn.

## Example
Turn: Alright, Sarah. Can you tell me which payroll period the issues occurred in?

payroll period: ?
**name: Sarah Johnson**
**employee iD: 123456**

# Inaccurate (MAP: False information)

The slot-value pair poorly represents the intended information in the focal turn.

## Example
Turn: Sure, let's have a sectional rehearsal for that. Bass and cello sections, 
please come forward. Great job, everyone. I noticed that in measure 100, some of
you were playing a bit too loudly. Please remember to keep the dynamics level 
until measure 112.

**beginning_note_of_song: 100**
**end_of_song: 112**

# Incomplete (MAP: Incomplete information)

The value for the particular slot only partially captures the full meaning 
presented in the focal turn and is thus incomplete.

## Example
Turn:  I believe the target audience for the yoga article would be pregnant 
women and new mothers, while the sugar article would appeal to a broader 
group interested in health and wellness.

**audience_type: Health & Wellness**

# Redundant (MAP: Redundant slots)

The slot-value pair represents the same information as another slot-value pair for the focal turn.

## Example
Turn: My name is John Smith and you can reach me at 555-1234.

name: John Smith
contact info: 555-1234
**first name: John**
**last name: Smith**
**phone number: 555-1234**

# Imprecise (MAP: Vague)

The slot-value representation is unclear and ambiguous in meaning when taken on its own 
rather than clearly and concisely summarizing some presented information from the focal turn.

## Example
Turn: When I was growing up, my parents always taught me to appreciate nature 
and not take it for granted. We used to go on camping trips and nature walks, 
and those memories stay with me even today.

parents teachings: Appreciate nature
**camping trips: Yes**
**nature walks: Yes**
**camping nature memories: Yes**

# Incomplete (MAP: Missing information)

Some information that is presented in the focal turn and is necessary for 
capturing its full meaning is not 
represented by any slot-value pair for the turn. 

## Example
Turn: Well, my current schedule is Monday through Friday, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. 
I was thinking about changing it up a bit.

day_of_appointment: Monday 
end_of_the_available_event: 5:00 pm
**Missing -> time_duration: 8:00 am to 5:00 pm**
**Missing -> current_schedule: Monday through Friday**
